Run 'main_function.m' to obtain dereverb speech and RIR estimates obtained for various constraints on RIR. The function also plots the narrowband RIR estimates for various methods.

The STFT and RIR parameters are set in 'parm' as shown below,
parm.analysis = %window length (1024 corresonds to 64ms when fs = 16000 samples/s)
parm.hop =  %hop size
parm.win =  % window type
parm.Nframe = % number of frames allocated for RIR
parm.Hlate = % number of frames to be considered as early part of RIR
