listen is anything going to happen here 
so what are we supposed to be doing here 
robin has logged into mit he should be here shortly 
we cant really start without a third director present 
speaker 3 maybe you can say a few words for introduction things which readers of ai dot uu dot future already know 
this meeting is called to order 
ill second that 
my name is speaker 3 
im the incorporator of this university 
right now we have a problem 
the name of this place is usenet university new network academy 
on wednesday i went to the secretary of state of texas and was told that we could not incorporate with the name college or university without being in existence for two years 
the problem is that what should we do 
we can incorporate outside of texas 
we can name this place something other than university 
for example we can name this place new network academy and state in the bylaws that we are affilated with usenet university 
the name quartznet has been suggested 
are there any motions to do something about the name or debate on the matter 
just one remark 
please 
yes 
i would like to know the guests from outside and the minutes of meeting that they are asked to participate in discussion if i am well informed 
if speaker 3 sets the no of speakers to 3 that only means that you have to type request before you can speak only 3 at a time 
true any guests with ideas can comment second and this applies already to this meeting though not necessarily to the question of naming 
there should be a ballot mechanism for uunna like the one alreday existing here or we should discuss this point except when we need secret ballots 
we can approve something by raising our hands is it necessary to incorporate in texas or is there somewhere else with less strict laws about this sort of thing 
its not necessary to incorporate in texas 
the only advantage in incorporating in texas is that i can file the papers myselfah the reason for incorporating is two fold 
first of all it gives this organization legal authority to open bank accounts sign contracts and similar things 
second it exempts this organization from american tax and makes contributions tax deductible 
also liability is number three if someone sues us and we are incorporated 
they cant touch any personal assets also incorporating means that uunna will have to deal with legal issues that will faces other similar structured organizations in essence if we incorporate and it works they we will pave the road for other companies like exxon or general motors to conduct business over computer networks 
the idea behind uunna is the creation of a university in every sense of the word which poses an argument against naming it quartznet i think or any other really artificial name 
i believe in starting small but with big goals 
incorporation isnt a big deal its trivial to file the paperwork 
the difficult part is getting the irs tax exemption 
you said it had to be around for two years before incorporating with the word university in the name right 
correct 
right thats what i was about to say 
i suspect that they would not like that the person at the secretary of state suggested that we incorporate with a name other than university and change it later on the other hand to be incorporated distinguishes uunna from many other nice ideas around on the net and sound financiation would open possibilities which not many other alternative institution has 
i dont think we will be ready to offer classed with credit for a few years 
the suggestion about using uunna was good 
then after the two year period has elapsed change it to uunna academy is not ruled out college 
is there is no problem naming this new network academy and stating that we are affiated with usenet university in the bylaws 
i move that this organization incorporate with the name new network academy and that we state in the bylaws that we are affiated with usenet university 
a director has to second this 
i second it 
this would underline the international character which we actually have 
is there any objection to changing the motion to strike out new network academy and replace with global network academy 
with no objections it is done 
any further debate 
donald works for an organization named global university 
i think that there is no problem with using the name 
there is another organization called global challenges network international network academy then for which i worked years ago 
no collision or contact since this is not a network in the sense of our net just fyi 
an environmental organization collecting scientists and egg heads world network academy 
the trouble with internet academy is that its restrictions to internet 
yeah 
but internet seems to have a well defined radius like bitnet but wider 
am i wrong 
i think global isnt too mad global as a word seems not to be overused lately
bad 
sorry not mad i like the name global 
any further debate 
name collisions 
the motion on the floor is that this organization incorporate as the global network academy 
all in favor please raise your hands 
only directors may vote  
all opposed
all opposed 
the motion passes 4 to 0 
next item on the agenda when how often to meet 
how many directors total 
speaker 4 had the idea of an informal meeting among the members 
once a week 
directors dont have to make it to that meeting 
with a formal directors meeting less often i think that one meeting every two weeks or once a month is a good schedule 
i vote for one formal board meeting per month and  once a month is probably often enough 
if necessary a special meeting can always be called 
not yet when people think that meeting has gone on too long 
someone can raise a motion to adjourn to get things started 
for a chatting one every two weeks in a place which we still have to build interest 
is there on this moo at least is there an email to discuss level of communication for the between meeting times 
yes there is a newsgroup devoted to usenet university 
i dont think we need to have formal meetings too often 
most of the debate and discussion is better done in informal meetings and the newsgroup the consensus seems to be for a once a month 
formal meeting with informal meetings scattered throughout any thoughts on the datetime of the meeting 
if on friday i would like the meeting to be later 
also some people from outside the us pleaded for meetigs after 2 pm ist 
its 10 am here in austin texas 
9 30 pm in mumbai 
germany 5 pm 
until the next meeting there will be an international clock here in this room where you can look up the other time zones and cities 
2 pm edt translates to 1800 utc 
would put us me and dariusz to early evening 1800 utc = 7 00 pm poland 
but it would be a bit better for people on the west coast of the us 
where does that put singapore if the meetings are 1800 utc 2 am 
i think ouch 2am is unacceptable 
we wont find a time which is acceptable to everyone 
its always 2 am somewhere 
any objections to suspending discussion on the time 
nope i move that the board formally meet once a month 
time to be decided later 
is there a second just to explain 
yes 
for me all those in favor please say aye 
aye 
he usually does not come in from home directors 
only aye 
all those opposed say no 
motion passes the later in the day the better at least for discussion 
non board meetings as you know people start coming in after 5 pm us time  
how is everyone holding up there 
only one more item of business that we have to discuss 
five minute recess
